    <h2>Welcome to Flavour Of Home!</h2>
    <p>
      Flavour Of Home is all about sharing the taste of home-cooked meals. We know life can be busy, but food has a way of bringing us back to our roots and happy memories with family. This website is a little place where you can find simple recipes that feel like a warm hug from home.

We started Flavour Of Home because we love honest, homemade food. It doesn’t have to be fancy or complicated — just good, tasty dishes made with care.

Here, you’ll find recipes that anyone can try — whether you’re just learning to cook or already enjoy spending time in the kitchen. Our goal is to make cooking easy and fun, so you can enjoy good food and share it with the people you love.

I’m Rutuja Vithalrao Biradar. A student who loves both cooking and creating websites. I made this site to combine my two passions and to help others find joy in cooking at home.

    <h2>Why We Started</h2>
    <p>
      Flavour Of Home began because I love food that brings people close. Life moves fast these days, but a homemade meal can slow us down and remind us of our family, our roots, and happy memories. This website is my way of sharing those warm, comforting tastes with anyone who misses the feeling of home.
